# Performance and Load Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive performance and load testing implementation for the Oriel Signal FX Pro application. The testing suite validates system performance under various conditions and provides detailed metrics for optimization.

## Requirements Coverage

This implementation addresses the following requirements:

### Requirement 7.4 (File Generation Performance)
- **WHEN file generation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show progress updates every 5 seconds**
- Tests file generation performance across different formats (MP3, MP4, MOV, GIF)
- Measures generation times, memory usage, and success rates
- Validates performance thresholds and identifies bottlenecks

### Requirement 9.4 (Resource Monitoring)
- **IF memory or performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL log resource usage information**
- Monitors memory usage patterns during operations
- Tracks CPU utilization and resource consumption
- Detects memory leaks and performance degradation

## Test Components

   - Use worker threads for CPU-intensive operations
   - Optimize codec settings for speed vs quality

2. **Concurrency Improvements**
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Use async/await patterns consistently
   - Add request queuing for resource-intensive operations

3. **Resource Management**
