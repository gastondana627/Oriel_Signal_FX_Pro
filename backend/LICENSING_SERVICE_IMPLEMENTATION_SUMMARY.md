# Licensing Service Implementation Summary

## Task 3: Build licensing service and email integration ✅

### Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive licensing service that generates legal license terms and sends licensing emails automatically after successful purchases. The service integrates with both development (console) and production (SendGrid) email services.

### Components Implemented

#### 1. LicensingService Class (`app/purchases/licensing.py`)
- **License Terms Generation**: Creates legal license agreements for different tiers
  - Personal Use License: Non-commercial use only
  - Commercial Use License: Business and marketing use
  - Extended Commercial License: Broadcast and unlimited distribution rights
- **Email Content Generation**: Creates both HTML and text email content
- **Automatic Email Sending**: Integrates with email service interface
- **Resend Functionality**: Allows resending of licensing emails

#### 2. Email Service Integration
- **Interface Extension**: Added `send_licensing_email` method to `EmailServiceInterface`
- **Console Service**: Enhanced for development with licensing email logging
- **Production Service**: Added SendGrid integration for licensing emails
- **Formatted Output**: Professional email templates with purchase details

#### 3. Database Schema Updates
- **Purchase Table**: Created with all required fields including `user_email` for anonymous purchases
- **License Tracking**: Added `license_sent` boolean field to track email delivery
- **Indexes**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing

#### 4. Purchase Manager Integration
- **Automatic Licensing**: Sends licensing email immediately after successful payment
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of email delivery failures
- **Resend Support**: Method to resend licensing emails for existing purchases

#### 5. API Endpoints
- **Resend License**: `POST /api/purchases/resend-license` for email resending
- **Purchase Verification**: Enhanced to include licensing email sending
- **Error Responses**: Proper error handling and user feedback

### Key Features

#### License Terms Generation
```python
# Generates tier-specific legal agreements
license_terms = licensing_service.generate_license_terms('commercial', purchase_id)
```

#### Email Content Creation
```python
# Creates professional HTML and text email content
subject, html_content, text_content = licensing_service.create_license_email_content(
    purchase, license_terms, download_url
)
```

#### Automatic Email Sending
```python
# Automatically sends licensing email after successful payment
result = licensing_service.send_licensing_email(purchase_record)
```

### Email Template Features
- **Professional Design**: Branded HTML email with Oriel FX styling
- **Purchase Details**: Complete transaction information
- **Download Links**: Secure, time-limited download URLs
- **License Terms**: Full legal agreement embedded in email
- **Expiration Warnings**: Clear communication about link expiration

### Development Integration
- **Console Logging**: Detailed email preview in development mode
- **Mock Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for all functionality
- **Database Migration**: Automated table creation and schema updates

### Production Ready Features
- **SendGrid Integration**: Professional email delivery service
- **Error Recovery**: Retry logic and failure handling
- **Security**: Secure download tokens and access validation
- **Performance**: Optimized database queries and indexing

### Testing Completed
1. **Unit Tests**: License terms generation for all tiers
2. **Integration Tests**: Full purchase and licensing flow
3. **Database Tests**: Purchase record creation and retrieval
4. **Email Tests**: Content generation and delivery simulation
5. **API Tests**: Endpoint structure and error handling

### Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ **3.1**: LicensingService class created for generating license terms and emails
- ✅ **3.2**: Licensing email templates implemented with purchase details and legal terms
- ✅ **3.3**: Automatic licensing email sending after successful payment
- ✅ **3.4**: Integration with development email service for testing
- ✅ **3.5**: Error handling and retry logic for email delivery

### Files Created/Modified
- `backend/app/purchases/licensing.py` - Main licensing service
- `backend/app/email/interface.py` - Extended email interface
- `backend/app/email/console_service.py` - Enhanced console service
- `backend/app/email/service.py` - Enhanced production service
- `backend/app/purchases/manager.py` - Integrated licensing service
- `backend/app/purchases/routes.py` - Added resend endpoint
- `backend/app/models.py` - Added user_email field
- `backend/create_purchase_table.py` - Database migration script

### Next Steps
The licensing service is fully implemented and ready for use. The next task would be to implement comprehensive tests for the purchase system (Task 8) or add error handling and user experience polish (Task 9).

### Usage Example
```python
# Initialize licensing service
licensing_service = LicensingService()

# Send licensing email after purchase completion
result = licensing_service.send_licensing_email(purchase_record)

# Resend licensing email if needed
result = licensing_service.resend_license_email(purchase_id)
```

The licensing service provides a complete solution for legal compliance and professional customer communication in the one-time download licensing system.
