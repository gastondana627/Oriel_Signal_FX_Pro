- Performance monitoring

## Usage Examples

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
python run_tests.py

# Specific categories
python run_tests.py --unit
python run_tests.py --integration
python run_tests.py --e2e

# With coverage
python run_tests.py --coverage --html

# Using Make
make test
make test-coverage
make test-fast

# Using pytest directly
pytest tests/
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

### Load Testing

```bash
# Light load
locust -f tests/load/locustfile.py --host=http://localhost:5000 -u 10 -r 2 -t 2m

# Heavy load
locust -f tests/load/locustfile.py --host=http://localhost:5000 -u 100 -r 10 -t 10m
```
