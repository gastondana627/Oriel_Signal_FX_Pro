## Test Execution

### Running Tests in Browser

1. Open `premium-features-test-runner.html` in a web browser
2. Select mock user plan from dropdown
3. Click individual test buttons or "Run Complete Test Suite"
4. View real-time results in the test results panel
5. Export results if needed

### Running Verification Script

```javascript
// In browser console or Node.js
PremiumFeaturesTestVerification.runCompleteVerification();
```

### Mock Environment

The tests use a comprehensive mock environment:

```javascript
// Mock Authentication Manager
mockAuthManager = {
    isAuthenticated: boolean,
    currentUser: { plan: 'free'|'starter'|'pro' },
    getCurrentUser: function,
    onStateChange: function
}

// Mock App Configuration
mockAppConfig = {
    plans: { free, starter, pro },
    getPlan: function,
    getAllPlans: function
}

// Mock Notification Manager
mockNotificationManager = {
    messages: array,
    show: function,
    clear: function
}
```

## Test Results Interpretation

### Success Criteria
- ✅ **Pass**: Test executed successfully and met expectations
- ❌ **Fail**: Test executed but did not meet expectations
- ℹ️ **Info**: Informational message or test setup

### Key Metrics
- **Total Tests**: Number of individual test cases executed
- **Passed**: Number of tests that passed successfully
- **Failed**: Number of tests that failed
- **Coverage**: Percentage of successful tests

### Expected Results

For a fully functional premium features system:
- Feature gating should have 100% pass rate
- Recording limits should be enforced correctly
- Export formats should be restricted appropriately
- Customization options should be gated properly
- Integration tests should show consistent behavior

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tests Not Running**
   - Ensure all dependency files are loaded
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify mock environment setup

2. **Feature Access Tests Failing**
   - Check mock user plan configuration
   - Verify feature definitions in FeatureManager
   - Ensure plan configurations are correct

3. **Recording Tests Failing**
   - Verify PremiumRecording class initialization
   - Check recording capability calculations
   - Ensure format restrictions are properly configured

4. **Customization Tests Failing**
   - Check DOM element creation for UI tests
   - Verify preset storage functionality
   - Ensure settings export/import works correctly

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
window.debugPremiumFeatures = true;
```

This will provide additional console output for troubleshooting.

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Add test cases to appropriate test suite in `premium-features-tests.js`
2. Update test runner UI if needed in `premium-features-test-runner.html`
3. Add verification logic to `verify-premium-features-tests.js`
4. Update this documentation

### Updating Test Data
- Modify mock objects to reflect new plans or features
- Update expected values in test assertions
- Adjust test coverage metrics

### Performance Considerations
- Tests run in browser environment with DOM manipulation
- Large test suites may take several seconds to complete
- Consider batching tests for better performance
