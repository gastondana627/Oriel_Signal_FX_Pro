# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will stabilize the Oriel FX audio visualizer application by fixing critical console errors, authentication issues, and UI rendering problems, while simultaneously implementing a modern geometric design with cyan/pink gradient color scheme and proper logo integration. The goal is to achieve a production-ready application that works flawlessly on both localhost and Railway deployment with zero console errors and a professional, cohesive visual design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to run without any console errors or warnings, so that I have a stable and professional experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN there SHALL be zero console errors, warnings, or spam messages
2. WHEN using any feature THEN the download modal retry loop SHALL be eliminated completely
3. WHEN making API calls THEN there SHALL be no 401 unauthorized errors for authenticated users
4. WHEN the app runs THEN health check failures SHALL be handled gracefully without console spam
5. WHEN preferences are synced THEN there SHALL be no authentication errors for logged-in users

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my email and user information to display correctly in the dashboard, so that I can see my account details properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create an account THEN my email SHALL appear correctly in the user status bar
2. WHEN I open the dashboard THEN my email and account information SHALL be displayed accurately
3. WHEN I log in THEN the UI SHALL switch from anonymous to authenticated state immediately
4. WHEN viewing my profile THEN all user data SHALL be populated correctly from the backend
5. WHEN the user status updates THEN the top-right UI SHALL render completely and look professional

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a modern geometric design with cyan/pink gradients and proper logo integration, so that it looks professional and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL display the geometric icosahedron logo with cyan/pink gradient
2. WHEN viewing any UI element THEN it SHALL use the cyan (#00D4FF) to pink (#FF6B6B) color scheme consistently
3. WHEN interacting with buttons and controls THEN they SHALL have geometric shapes with neon glow effects
4. WHEN using the app THEN the dark background SHALL complement the geometric design elements
5. WHEN viewing on any device THEN the geometric theme SHALL be responsive and maintain visual quality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work perfectly on both localhost and production environments, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing localhost:3000 THEN all features SHALL work identically to production
2. WHEN using Railway production deployment THEN there SHALL be no environment-specific errors
3. WHEN switching between environments THEN user authentication SHALL work seamlessly
4. WHEN making API calls THEN they SHALL succeed on both localhost and production
5. WHEN downloading content THEN the process SHALL work reliably in both environments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing functionality to work flawlessly with the new design, so that I don't lose any features during the redesign.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using audio upload THEN it SHALL work with the new geometric UI design
2. WHEN purchasing credits or subscriptions THEN the payment flow SHALL work with geometric styling
3. WHEN downloading visualizations THEN the process SHALL complete successfully with geometric progress indicators
4. WHEN using authentication THEN login/register SHALL work with geometric form styling
5. WHEN accessing any feature THEN it SHALL maintain full functionality while using the new visual design

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable code with proper error handling, so that the application is stable and easy to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully without console spam
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN there SHALL be proper retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN the app initializes THEN all components SHALL load without race conditions
4. WHEN debugging THEN logs SHALL be clean, informative, and not repetitive
5. WHEN deploying THEN the build process SHALL complete without warnings or errors
