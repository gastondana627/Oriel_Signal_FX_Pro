# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the Oriel FX audio visualizer interface to match a modern geometric design with cyan/pink gradient color scheme, featuring a sleek dark background with neon geometric elements. The redesign will maintain all existing functionality while providing a more visually striking and cohesive user experience that aligns with the geometric audio visualization aesthetic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to have a modern geometric design with cyan/pink gradients, so that the UI matches the visual style of the audio visualizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the interface SHALL display a dark background with geometric design elements
2. WHEN viewing any UI component THEN it SHALL use the cyan (#00D4FF) to pink (#FF6B6B) gradient color scheme
3. WHEN interacting with buttons and controls THEN they SHALL have geometric shapes and neon glow effects
4. WHEN the theme is applied THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent geometric styling across all interface elements, so that the entire application feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the control panel THEN it SHALL have geometric borders and gradient backgrounds
2. WHEN viewing modals and popups THEN they SHALL use consistent geometric styling with the main interface
3. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN they SHALL display smooth neon glow animations
4. WHEN using the application on mobile THEN the geometric theme SHALL be responsive and maintain visual quality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the geometric theme to enhance the audio visualization experience, so that the UI complements rather than distracts from the main visualizer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the visualizer is running THEN the UI elements SHALL have subtle transparency to not obstruct the view
2. WHEN audio is playing THEN UI elements MAY pulse or glow in sync with the audio (optional enhancement)
3. WHEN downloading content THEN progress indicators SHALL use geometric shapes and gradient animations
4. WHEN the theme is active THEN it SHALL maintain good contrast for accessibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the ability to toggle between the current theme and the new geometric theme, so that I can choose my preferred visual style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing theme settings THEN there SHALL be an option to switch between classic and geometric themes
2. WHEN switching themes THEN the change SHALL be applied immediately without page reload
3. WHEN a theme is selected THEN the preference SHALL be saved and persist across sessions
4. WHEN switching themes THEN all UI components SHALL update consistently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the geometric theme to work seamlessly with the existing payment and authentication systems, so that all features remain fully functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing payment modals THEN they SHALL use the geometric theme styling
2. WHEN using authentication forms THEN they SHALL have geometric input fields and buttons
3. WHEN viewing the user dashboard THEN it SHALL display with geometric cards and layouts
4. WHEN accessing any existing feature THEN it SHALL work identically to the current implementation
