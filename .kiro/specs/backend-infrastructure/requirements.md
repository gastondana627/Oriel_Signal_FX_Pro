# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building the backend infrastructure for Oriel_Signal_FX_Pro, a commercial audio-reactive visualizer application. The backend will transform the existing frontend prototype into a full-stack web application capable of processing payments, rendering high-quality MP4 videos, and delivering them to customers via cloud storage and email.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend Project Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly structured Flask backend application deployed to Railway, so that I have a foundation for building the commercial features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend directory is created THEN the system SHALL contain a Flask application with proper project structure
2. WHEN the Flask application is initialized THEN the system SHALL include basic routing, error handling, and configuration management
3. WHEN the application is deployed to Railway THEN the system SHALL be accessible via a public URL with a "Hello World" endpoint
4. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL support different configurations for development and production
5. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL include a .gitignore file to prevent committing temporary files, virtual environments, and secrets

### Requirement 2: Payment Processing Integration

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to securely pay for video rendering services, so that I can access the premium MP4 export functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a payment is initiated THEN the system SHALL create a secure Stripe payment session
2. WHEN payment is successful THEN the system SHALL store the transaction record and grant video rendering access
3. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages to the frontend
4. WHEN a webhook is received from Stripe THEN the system SHALL verify and process the payment confirmation
5. IF a user attempts to render without payment THEN the system SHALL reject the request with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 3: MP4 Video Rendering Engine

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to generate high-quality MP4 videos of my customized audio visualizations, so that I can use them in my projects or social media.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rendering request is received THEN the system SHALL validate the audio file and visualization parameters
2. WHEN rendering begins THEN the system SHALL use a headless browser to capture the visualization
3. WHEN the visualization is captured THEN the system SHALL use FFmpeg to encode it as an MP4 video
4. WHEN rendering is complete THEN the system SHALL store the video file in cloud storage
5. WHEN rendering fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and cleanup temporary files
6. IF the audio file exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL reject the request with appropriate messaging
7. WHEN a rendering request is received THEN the system SHALL add it to a job queue (Redis/RQ) for background processing
8. WHEN multiple rendering requests are queued THEN the system SHALL process them via worker processes without blocking the main application

### Requirement 4: Cloud Storage and File Management

**User Story:** As a customer, I want my rendered videos to be securely stored and easily accessible, so that I can download them when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video is rendered THEN the system SHALL upload it to Google Cloud Storage with a unique identifier
2. WHEN a video is uploaded THEN the system SHALL generate a secure, time-limited download URL
3. WHEN a download URL is requested THEN the system SHALL verify the user's access rights
4. WHEN videos are older than 30 days THEN the system SHALL automatically delete them to manage storage costs
5. IF storage upload fails THEN the system SHALL retry the operation and notify the user of any permanent failures

### Requirement 5: Email Delivery System

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to receive an email with my video download link, so that I can access my rendered content even if I close the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video rendering is complete THEN the system SHALL send an email with the download link using SendGrid
2. WHEN an email is sent THEN the system SHALL include the video details, download instructions, and expiration information
3. WHEN email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry sending and log the failure for manual follow-up
4. WHEN a user provides an invalid email THEN the system SHALL validate the email format before processing
5. IF the email service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue emails for later delivery

### Requirement 6: API Security and Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to be secure and protected from abuse, so that the service remains stable and costs are controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate JWT authentication tokens for protected endpoints
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and retry information
3. WHEN file uploads occur THEN the system SHALL validate file types, sizes, and scan for malicious content
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them securely without exposing sensitive information
5. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL implement temporary blocking mechanisms

### Requirement 7: User Authentication and Management

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to create an account and manage my profile, so that I can view my purchase history and re-download my videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL create an account with email and secure password storage
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL validate credentials and return a JWT token
3. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send a secure reset link via email
4. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display their purchase history and available downloads
5. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication for protected actions
6. IF a user attempts to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messaging

### Requirement 8: Admin Interface

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a dashboard to manage the system, so that I can monitor users, jobs, and payments without direct database access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin logs in THEN the system SHALL provide access to a Flask-Admin dashboard
2. WHEN viewing the admin panel THEN the system SHALL display user accounts, rendering jobs, and payment records
3. WHEN a rendering job fails THEN the admin SHALL be able to view error details and retry the job
4. WHEN managing users THEN the admin SHALL be able to view account details and disable accounts if needed
5. WHEN viewing system metrics THEN the admin SHALL see storage usage, job queue status, and error rates

### Requirement 9: Frontend Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend and backend to work seamlessly together, so that I have a smooth experience from customization to video delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN the system SHALL handle CORS properly for the domain
2. WHEN payment status changes THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates to the frontend
3. WHEN rendering progress updates occur THEN the system SHALL send status updates via polling endpoints
4. WHEN the frontend requests video status THEN the system SHALL return current processing state and estimated completion time
5. IF the backend is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
