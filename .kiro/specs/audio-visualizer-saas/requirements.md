# Audio Visualizer SaaS Integration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating the existing Oriel FX audio visualizer frontend with the backend API to create a full-featured SaaS audio visualization service. The integration will transform a standalone visualizer into a comprehensive platform with user authentication, payment processing, usage tracking, and premium features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account and log in to access personalized features and track my usage, so that I can have a customized experience and manage my subscription.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the visualizer THEN the system SHALL display login/register options in the UI
2. WHEN a user clicks "Register" THEN the system SHALL show a registration modal with email and password fields
3. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL call `/api/auth/register` and create an account
4. WHEN a user clicks "Login" THEN the system SHALL show a login modal with email and password fields
5. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL call `/api/auth/login` and receive a JWT token
6. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL store the JWT token securely and show user status in the UI
7. WHEN a user clicks "Logout" THEN the system SHALL clear the JWT token and return to guest mode

### Requirement 2: Usage Tracking and Limits

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my download usage and limits clearly displayed, so that I understand my current plan and when I need to upgrade.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is logged in THEN the system SHALL display their current download count and limits
2. WHEN a user downloads content THEN the system SHALL call `/api/user/usage` to track the download
3. WHEN a user reaches their download limit THEN the system SHALL prevent further downloads and show upgrade options
4. WHEN a user views their profile THEN the system SHALL show download history from `/api/user/history`
5. IF a user is not logged in THEN the system SHALL use local storage limits (current behavior)

### Requirement 3: Payment Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to purchase credits or subscribe to a plan to get more downloads and premium features, so that I can use the service without limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reaches their free limit THEN the system SHALL show payment options instead of "Buy Me a Coffee"
2. WHEN a user clicks "Upgrade" THEN the system SHALL call `/api/payments/create-session` to start Stripe checkout
3. WHEN a payment is successful THEN the system SHALL update the user's credits/subscription status
4. WHEN a user has active credits THEN the system SHALL allow downloads and show remaining balance
5. WHEN a user views their account THEN the system SHALL show payment history and current plan status

### Requirement 4: User Dashboard

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a dashboard where I can manage my account, view my usage, and customize my preferences, so that I have full control over my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks their profile THEN the system SHALL show a user dashboard modal
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display account info, usage stats, and payment status
3. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL call `/api/user/profile` to save changes
4. WHEN a user views settings THEN the system SHALL show saved preferences and allow customization
5. WHEN a user saves preferences THEN the system SHALL store them on the backend for cross-device sync

### Requirement 5: Premium Features

**User Story:** As a paying user, I want access to premium features like longer recordings, higher quality exports, and saved presets, so that I get additional value from my subscription.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has an active subscription THEN the system SHALL enable premium features
2. WHEN a premium user downloads THEN the system SHALL offer extended recording times (60s vs 30s)
3. WHEN a premium user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL show additional customization options
4. WHEN a premium user creates visualizations THEN the system SHALL allow saving and loading custom presets
5. IF a user's subscription expires THEN the system SHALL gracefully downgrade to free tier features

### Requirement 6: Seamless User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication and payment features to integrate smoothly with the existing visualizer, so that the core experience remains intuitive and enjoyable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is added THEN the system SHALL maintain the current visualizer UI and controls
2. WHEN a user is not logged in THEN the system SHALL work exactly as it does currently
3. WHEN authentication modals appear THEN the system SHALL pause the visualizer and resume after closing
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly messages and fallback gracefully
5. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue working in offline mode with local storage

### Requirement 7: Data Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my preferences and settings to sync across devices when I'm logged in, so that I have a consistent experience everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in on a new device THEN the system SHALL load their saved preferences
2. WHEN a user changes settings THEN the system SHALL sync them to the backend
3. WHEN a user has saved presets THEN the system SHALL make them available across all devices
4. WHEN offline changes are made THEN the system SHALL sync them when connectivity is restored
5. IF sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent changes

### Requirement 8: Analytics and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to track user engagement and system performance, so that I can improve the service and make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the visualizer THEN the system SHALL track usage analytics
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them for monitoring and debugging
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL capture metrics for optimization
4. WHEN users convert to paid plans THEN the system SHALL track conversion funnels
5. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL provide metrics for scaling decisions
