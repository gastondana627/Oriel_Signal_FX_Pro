# Development Email Service Requirements

## Introduction

Configure a development-friendly email service that allows password reset and other email functionality to work in local development without requiring external email providers. This will enable testing of email flows during development while maintaining production SendGrid integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Development Email Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want email functionality to work in development mode, so that I can test password reset and other email features locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in development mode THEN the system SHALL use console logging for email delivery
2. WHEN an email is sent in development THEN the system SHALL log the complete email content to the console
3. WHEN an email is sent in development THEN the system SHALL log recipient, subject, and content in a readable format
4. IF SendGrid credentials are not configured THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to console logging
5. WHEN the application runs in production mode THEN the system SHALL use SendGrid for actual email delivery

### Requirement 2: Email Content Visibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the actual email content during testing, so that I can verify email templates and links work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a password reset email is sent in development THEN the system SHALL display the reset link in the console
2. WHEN a welcome email is sent in development THEN the system SHALL display the complete HTML and text content
3. WHEN a video completion email is sent in development THEN the system SHALL display the download link and job details
4. WHEN any email is sent in development THEN the system SHALL format the output for easy reading and testing

### Requirement 3: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the email service to automatically detect the environment, so that I don't need to manually configure different settings for development vs production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL detect if SendGrid credentials are available
2. IF SendGrid credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL automatically enable development mode
3. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL log a clear message indicating console email mode is active
4. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate email delivery method without code changes

### Requirement 4: Testing Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily test email functionality, so that I can verify password reset and other email flows work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing password reset THEN the system SHALL provide the reset token/link in console output
2. WHEN testing email templates THEN the system SHALL display both HTML and plain text versions
3. WHEN testing email delivery THEN the system SHALL return success responses consistent with production
4. WHEN debugging email issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback behavior
