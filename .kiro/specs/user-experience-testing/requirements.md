# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification focuses on comprehensive user experience testing and refinement for the Oriel Signal FX Pro application. The goal is to ensure seamless user flows for account creation, authentication, media downloads (particularly MP4 and MOV files), and improved development experience through refined terminal logging. This testing phase will validate core user journeys and identify areas for improvement in the client-side experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account seamlessly, so that I can access the audio visualizer features and save my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Create Account" button THEN the system SHALL display a registration modal with clear form fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create the account and automatically log them in
3. WHEN a user submits invalid registration data THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages without losing form data
4. WHEN account creation is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect to the main application interface
5. IF the registration process fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want to log in quickly and reliably, so that I can access my saved projects and continue working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and redirect to the main interface within 3 seconds
2. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message without clearing the username field
3. WHEN a user is already logged in THEN the system SHALL maintain session state across browser refreshes
4. IF login fails due to server issues THEN the system SHALL display a helpful error message with retry options
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all session data and redirect to the login page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user creating audio visualizations, I want to download my work in multiple formats (MP3, MP4, MOV, GIF), so that I can use the content across different platforms and applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the download button THEN the system SHALL display a modal with format options (MP3, MP4, MOV, GIF)
2. WHEN a user selects MP4 format THEN the system SHALL generate and download a high-quality MP4 file
3. WHEN a user selects MOV format THEN the system SHALL generate and download a MOV file compatible with professional video editing software
4. WHEN a user selects any format THEN the system SHALL show progress indication during file generation
5. IF file generation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and offer retry options
6. WHEN download is complete THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation and file location information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working on the application, I want clear and informative terminal logs, so that I can quickly identify issues and monitor system health during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development servers start THEN the system SHALL display clear startup messages with port numbers and URLs
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL log request method, endpoint, and response status
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with timestamps and context
4. WHEN file operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log file paths and operation results
5. IF authentication events occur THEN the system SHALL log login/logout events with user identification
6. WHEN the system is running normally THEN logs SHALL be formatted consistently and easy to read

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the download modal to properly intercept download requests, so that I can choose my preferred format instead of automatically downloading MP3.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks any download button THEN the system SHALL prevent immediate file download
2. WHEN the download modal opens THEN the system SHALL display all available format options clearly
3. WHEN a user cancels the modal THEN the system SHALL return to the previous state without downloading anything
4. IF the modal fails to load THEN the system SHALL fall back to direct MP3 download with user notification
5. WHEN a format is selected THEN the system SHALL initiate download for that specific format only

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user testing the application, I want reliable server startup and connectivity, so that I can test all features without technical interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the restart script is executed THEN the system SHALL kill existing servers and start fresh instances
2. WHEN servers start THEN the system SHALL verify both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 8000) are accessible
3. WHEN servers are running THEN the system SHALL display connection URLs and test credentials
4. IF server startup fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting steps
5. WHEN both servers are ready THEN the system SHALL indicate readiness for testing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent and reliable media file generation, so that my downloaded content maintains quality and compatibility across different devices and software.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating MP4 files THEN the system SHALL use H.264 codec with AAC audio for maximum compatibility
2. WHEN generating MOV files THEN the system SHALL maintain original quality settings and metadata
3. WHEN generating any video format THEN the system SHALL preserve audio synchronization
4. IF file generation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show progress updates every 5 seconds
5. WHEN file generation completes THEN the system SHALL verify file integrity before offering download

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during all operations, so that I understand what the system is doing and can take appropriate action if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation messages
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
4. IF network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL detect and notify the user with retry options
5. WHEN the system is processing large files THEN progress indicators SHALL show percentage completion

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix issues during development and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them to both console and server
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log request details, response codes, and error messages
3. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL log file paths, operation types, and failure reasons
4. IF memory or performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL log resource usage information
5. WHEN user actions trigger errors THEN the system SHALL log user context and action details

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a tester, I want a systematic testing workflow, so that I can efficiently validate all user flows and identify issues quickly.
