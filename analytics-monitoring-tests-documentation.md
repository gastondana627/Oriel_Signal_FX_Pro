- **App Configuration**: Feature flags and settings
- **Browser APIs**: Performance, Navigator, LocalStorage
- **DOM Elements**: Event simulation and interaction

### Test Data
- **User Data**: Various user types and plans
- **File Data**: Different file types and sizes
- **Error Scenarios**: Network, authentication, payment errors
- **Performance Metrics**: API response times, user interactions
- **Analytics Events**: User journeys and conversion funnels

## Maintenance and Updates

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Use appropriate describe/test blocks for organization
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Mock external dependencies appropriately
5. Verify test isolation and cleanup

### Updating Existing Tests
1. Maintain backward compatibility when possible
2. Update mock data to reflect real-world scenarios
3. Ensure test coverage remains comprehensive
4. Document any breaking changes

### Performance Considerations
- Tests are designed to run quickly in the browser
- Mock objects minimize external dependencies
- Async operations are properly awaited
- Memory usage is optimized for large test suites

## Integration with CI/CD

The test suite can be integrated into continuous integration pipelines:
- **Headless Browser Testing**: Use Puppeteer or similar for automated runs
- **Test Reporting**: Generate JUnit-compatible reports
- **Coverage Analysis**: Track test coverage metrics
- **Performance Regression**: Monitor test execution times

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Mock Setup**: Ensure all required mocks are properly initialized
2. **Async Operations**: Verify proper async/await usage
3. **Test Isolation**: Check for test interdependencies
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Test across different browsers

### Debugging Tips
1. Use browser developer tools for detailed error inspection
2. Check console output for additional error information
3. Verify mock function calls and return values
4. Test individual components in isolation

This comprehensive test suite ensures the reliability and correctness of the analytics and monitoring system, providing confidence in the application's ability to track user behavior, handle errors gracefully, and monitor performance effectively.
