## Test Execution

### Running Tests

1. **All Tests**: Execute complete test suite covering both format conversion and progress tracking
2. **Format Tests Only**: Execute only file format conversion tests
3. **Progress Tests Only**: Execute only progress tracking tests

### Test Runner Features

- **Real-time Progress**: Visual progress indication during test execution
- **Console Output**: Detailed logging of test execution and results
- **Result Summary**: Pass/fail statistics and execution time
- **Error Details**: Detailed error messages for failed tests
- **Interactive Controls**: Separate execution of test categories

### Expected Results

All tests should pass with a 100% success rate when the download utilities are functioning correctly. Any failures indicate issues with:

- File format conversion calculations
- Quality setting configurations
- Progress tracking mechanisms
- Error handling implementations

## Integration with Main Application

These unit tests validate the core utilities used by:

- **Download Modal**: Format selection and file generation
- **Progress Indicators**: Real-time download progress display
- **File Generation**: Backend file conversion processes
- **Quality Selection**: User-selected quality settings

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

When adding new download utilities or modifying existing ones:

1. Add corresponding unit tests to validate new functionality
2. Update test documentation with new test descriptions
3. Ensure new tests follow the established patterns
4. Verify integration with the test runner

### Test Data Updates

Mock data should be updated when:

- New audio formats are supported
- Quality levels are modified
- File size calculations change
- Progress tracking requirements change

## Performance Considerations

- Tests use mock data and simulated operations for speed
- File generation is simulated rather than creating actual files
- Progress tracking uses shortened delays for faster execution
- Memory usage is monitored during test execution

## Error Scenarios Tested

1. **Invalid Progress Values**: Out-of-range progress updates
2. **Callback Errors**: Exceptions thrown by progress callbacks
3. **Invalid Quality Settings**: Unknown quality levels
4. **Invalid Format Types**: Unsupported file formats
5. **Memory Management**: Resource cleanup during operations

## Success Criteria

Tests are considered successful when:

- All format conversion calculations are accurate
- Progress tracking works reliably across all scenarios
- Error handling prevents system failures
- Performance remains within acceptable limits
- Integration points work correctly with main application

This comprehensive test suite ensures the reliability and accuracy of download utilities, supporting the overall user experience testing requirements.
