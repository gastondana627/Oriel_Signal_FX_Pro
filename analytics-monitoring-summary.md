**Key Features:**
- Session tracking with unique session IDs
- User identification and plan-based tracking
- Visualizer interaction monitoring
- Audio upload and processing tracking
- Download attempt and completion tracking
- Authentication event tracking
- Payment and subscription event tracking
- Feature usage tracking with premium feature detection
- Automatic page view and navigation tracking
- Modal interaction tracking

### 2. Error Monitor (`error-monitor.js`)
- **Global Error Handling**: Captures JavaScript errors, resource loading errors, and unhandled promise rejections
- **User-Friendly Recovery**: Provides recovery options and user-friendly error messages
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Logs API errors, authentication errors, payment errors, visualizer errors, and file processing errors
- **Error Classification**: Categorizes errors by type and severity
- **Offline Storage**: Stores errors locally when offline for later transmission

**Key Features:**
- Automatic error boundary creation
- Context-aware error reporting
- Critical error detection and immediate reporting
- Recovery action suggestions
- Error sanitization for sensitive data
- Local storage backup for offline scenarios

### 3. Performance Monitor (`performance-monitor.js`)
- **Core Web Vitals**: Tracks LCP, FID, and CLS metrics
- **API Response Monitoring**: Monitors API call performance and response times
- **Resource Loading**: Tracks resource loading times and sizes
- **Memory Usage**: Monitors JavaScript heap usage
- **User Experience Metrics**: Tracks interaction responsiveness and frame rates
- **Performance Insights**: Provides actionable performance recommendations

**Key Features:**
- Navigation timing tracking
- Paint timing and rendering metrics
- Long task detection
- File processing performance monitoring
- Visualizer operation performance tracking
- Connection quality monitoring
- Performance benchmarking utilities

### 4. Monitoring Integration (`monitoring-integration.js`)
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates all monitoring components with existing application
- **Automatic Setup**: Automatically sets up monitoring for auth, payment, and usage systems
- **Cross-Component Communication**: Enables data sharing between monitoring components
- **User State Management**: Synchronizes user information across all monitoring systems
- **Centralized Control**: Provides unified control for enabling/disabling monitoring

**Key Features:**
- Dependency injection and initialization
- Method interception for existing managers
- Event listener setup for automatic tracking
- User session management across components
- Centralized monitoring status and reporting

## Integration Points

### Authentication System
- Login/register attempt and success tracking
- Authentication error monitoring
- Performance tracking for auth operations
- User identification across monitoring systems

### Payment System
- Payment initiation and completion tracking
- Payment error monitoring and recovery
- Conversion funnel tracking for payment flows
- Performance monitoring for payment operations

### Usage Tracking System
- Download tracking and limit monitoring
- Usage pattern analytics
- Performance monitoring for usage operations
- Error handling for usage-related issues

### Visualizer System
- User interaction tracking (clicks, settings changes)
- Audio upload and processing monitoring
- Download attempt and completion tracking
- Performance monitoring for visualizer operations
- Error handling for visualizer-related issues

## Backend API Endpoints

The monitoring system expects the following backend endpoints:

### Analytics Endpoints
- `POST /api/analytics/track` - Send analytics events
- `GET /api/analytics/conversion` - Get conversion funnel data

### Monitoring Endpoints
- `POST /api/monitoring/errors` - Send error reports
- `POST /api/monitoring/performance` - Send performance metrics

## Configuration

Monitoring is configured through the existing `AppConfig` system:

```javascript
// Feature flags for monitoring
featureFlags: {
    userTracking: true,           // Enable analytics tracking
    errorReporting: true,         // Enable error monitoring
    performanceMonitoring: true   // Enable performance monitoring
}

// Environment-specific settings
analytics: {
    enabled: true  // Enable/disable analytics
},
logging: {
    level: 'info',    // Logging level
    enabled: true     // Enable/disable logging
}
```

## Privacy and Compliance

- **User Consent**: Respects user preferences for tracking
- **Data Minimization**: Only collects necessary data for functionality
- **Anonymization**: Sensitive data is sanitized before transmission
- **Local Storage**: Provides offline functionality with local data storage
- **GDPR Compliance**: Includes user control over data collection

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal Overhead**: Designed for minimal performance impact
- **Efficient Batching**: Events are batched to reduce network requests
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Includes queue size limits and cleanup
- **Offline Resilience**: Graceful degradation when backend unavailable

## Development and Debugging

- **Development Mode**: Enhanced logging and debugging in development
- **Error Boundaries**: Prevents monitoring errors from affecting main application
- **Status Reporting**: Provides monitoring status and health information
- **Manual Controls**: Allows manual enabling/disabling of monitoring features

## Testing and Validation

The implementation includes:
- Syntax validation (all files pass diagnostics)
- Error handling for all failure scenarios
- Graceful degradation when dependencies unavailable
- Offline mode support and testing
- Cross-browser compatibility considerations

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Implementation**: Implement corresponding backend endpoints
2. **Dashboard Integration**: Add monitoring data to user dashboard
3. **Alerting System**: Set up alerts for critical errors and performance issues
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Create admin dashboard for analytics insights
5. **A/B Testing**: Implement A/B testing framework using analytics data

## Files Created

1. `analytics-manager.js` - Core analytics tracking system
2. `error-monitor.js` - Error monitoring and logging system
3. `performance-monitor.js` - Performance metrics collection system
4. `monitoring-integration.js` - Integration layer for all monitoring components
5. Updated `index.html` - Added script includes for monitoring components

The implementation successfully addresses all requirements from Requirement 8 (Analytics and Monitoring) and provides a solid foundation for data-driven decision making and system optimization.
